Cook's notes
Oven temperatures are for conventional; if using fan-forced (convection), reduce the temperature by 20˚C. | We use Australian tablespoons and cups: 1 teaspoon equals 5 ml; 1 tablespoon equals 20 ml; 1 cup equals 250 ml. | All herbs are fresh (unless specified) and cups are lightly packed. | All vegetables are medium size and peeled, unless specified. | All eggs are 55-60 g, unless specified.

Instructions

Process chilli, ginger, garlic, coriander, cumin, half the spinach and 60 ml water in a food processor to a rough paste; add more water to loosen if necessary.

Heat 1 tbsp ghee in a large, deep frying pan over high heat. Add paneer and cook, turning occasionally, for 3 minutes or until golden on all sides. Using a slotted spoon, transfer to a bowl and set aside.

Heat remaining 1 tbsp ghee in the same pan over medium heat. Add onion and cook for 3 minutes or until softened. Add spinach paste and cook for 2 minutes or until fragrant. Add tomatoes, cream, 60ml water and the paneer, and cook for 3 minutes or until tomatoes are starting to soften. Add remaining bunch of spinach and cook for 3 minutes or until just wilted. Serve seasoned with salt and pepper.

 

Note

• Paneer is an Indian cheese available from select supermarkets and greengrocers.
